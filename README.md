We did classification of Temperature and Conditions for four major countries. 

We used five classification models:<br>
Linear SVC<br>
Decision Tree Classifier<br/>
KNN Classifier<br/>
Random Forest Classifier<br/>
Gaussian NB Classifier<br/>

# Notebooks related to Classification:

Classification_UK<br/>
Classification_US<br/>
Classification_Australia<br/>
Classification_Russia<br/>

From all those classifiers Linear SVC and Guassian NB Classifiers performed consistently for all the countries used and gave better results.
